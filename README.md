# GitHub Auto-Update

#### This is a way to make all your branches auto update to the latest push on the main branch. This uses GitHub actions. 

This repo is a template repo so you can use this to start a new repository. This will fail on private repositories.

#### Just copy the .github folder into your repository. </br>

#### In ./github/workflows/main.yml replace `<your email here>` with your GitHub email and `<your username here>` with your GitHub username.

#### After you create this GitHub will automatically create a GitHub action and start it on every push to the main branch.

### PS: The action will fail in this repository as I have not replaced `<your email here>` and `<your username here>`. To see the action actually working see [this repo](https://github.com/Wambyat/IISC-Determining-anomalies-in-the-stock-market)
