# GitHub Auto-Update

This is a way to make all your branches auto update to the latest push on the main branch.

This uses GitHub actions. 

Just copy the .github folder into your repository. In ./github/workflows/main.yml replace \<your email here\> with your GitHub email and \<your username here\> with your GitHub usernme.
After you create this GitHub will automatically create a GitHub action and start it on every push to the main branch.
